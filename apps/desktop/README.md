# @app/desktop

The frost Electron app (main, preload, renderer), packaged with Electron Forge.

## Scripts
- `pnpm --filter @app/desktop start` — dev run (Vite dev server).
- `pnpm --filter @app/desktop build` — `electron-forge package` for the host platform (Linux CI).
- `pnpm --filter @app/desktop test` / `test:e2e` — unit tests / Playwright e2e on the unpackaged
  build (run `build` first; needs a display).
- `pnpm make:mac` (repo root, on macOS) — `electron-forge make --platform darwin --arch arm64`
  (see [Building on a Mac](#building-on-a-mac)).
- `pnpm verify:mac` (repo root, on macOS, after `make:mac`) — checks the bundle id, arch,
  signature and entitlements, fuses, launch and debugging lockdown, and that the `.app` inside the
  published zip and dmg verifies too (`specs/macos-package.feature.md`). CI:
  `.github/workflows/macos.yml`.

## Building on a Mac
Prerequisites:
- An Apple Silicon Mac (builds are arm64 only for now).
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`): `codesign`, plus the compiler node-gyp needs
  to build the DMG maker's native addons (`fs-xattr`, `macos-alias`).
- Python 3 (for node-gyp; the one the Command Line Tools ship is enough).
- Node ≥ 22.18 (`verify-mac-package.mjs` imports the `specs/*.ts` files with Node's built-in type
  stripping).
- pnpm 12.15.0 (`package.json#packageManager`). Without changing a global pnpm, prefix each
  command below with `npx -y pnpm@12.15.0` instead of `pnpm`.

From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm make:mac
pnpm verify:mac
```

Artifacts, under `apps/desktop/out/`:
- `frost-darwin-arm64/frost.app`
- `make/zip/darwin/arm64/frost-darwin-arm64-<version>.zip`
- `make/dmg/arm64/frost-<version>-arm64.dmg` (ULFO)

## macOS signing
By default the app is **ad-hoc signed**. A build made on your own Mac is not quarantined and opens
normally. A **downloaded** build (e.g. the `frost-macos-arm64` artifact of the macOS workflow, a zip
holding the `.zip` and the `.dmg` above) is quarantined, and Gatekeeper refuses it because it is not
notarized. macOS 15 and later no longer offer Control-click › Open; either:

- **(a)** remove the quarantine attribute before mounting the dmg:
  `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/frost-*.dmg` (or, after copying the app out,
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/frost.app`); or
- **(b)** try to open the app once, then go to System Settings › Privacy & Security and click
  **Open Anyway** (macOS asks once more to confirm).

Developer ID signing and notarization turn on only when **all four** variables are set when running
`make:mac`; otherwise none of them is used:

| Variable | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | `osxSign.identity`, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)` (in the keychain) |
| `APPLE_ID` | notarytool Apple ID |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | notarytool app-specific password |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | notarytool team id |

Real signing uses the hardened runtime with only `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`
(`MAC_ENTITLEMENTS` in `specs/macos-package.spec.ts`). It has not been exercised yet (no Developer
ID); CI never receives these secrets.

## Follow-ups
App icon (Electron's default for now), x64/universal builds, signing in CI, signed auto-update.
