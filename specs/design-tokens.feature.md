# Feature: Design tokens (Signal foundation and values)

Spec: `specs/design-tokens.spec.ts` (`TOKENS_STYLESHEET`, `SIGNAL_TOKENS`, `THEMED_SIGNAL_GROUPS`,
`SIGNAL_NAMES_WITH_LEGACY_VALUES`, `LEGACY_TOKEN_MIGRATION`, `CONTRAST_PAIRS`, `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`, `SIGNAL_SURFACES`,
`FONTS_STYLESHEET`, `GEIST_PACKAGE`, `GEIST_FONTS_ALIAS`, `TEXT_BODY_EMPHASIS_WEIGHT`, `BUNDLED_FONTS`). Source of truth:
the Signal token sheet (its values and its Migration table) and the round-2 council decisions.
Code: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/tokens.css` and `fonts.css`, imported by `main.tsx`. Each line maps to one named test.

## Decisions
- **One token source.** Every custom property that lives on `:root` is declared in `tokens.css`,
  light in a `:root` block and dark in a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` `:root` block that
  redefines only the names whose value changes. No other renderer stylesheet declares a custom
  property on `:root` (or `html`). Properties scoped to a component's own selector (`.seo-speed`,
  `.tab`, `.seo-ring`, `.devtools`, …) stay beside their rules.
- **Loaded first.** `main.tsx` imports `tokens.css` before any other stylesheet and before `App`
  (whose components import the feature stylesheets). No stylesheet is lazy-loaded.
- **Foundation: no visual change.** The legacy tokens moved into `tokens.css` with their names and
  values unchanged; a rule body anywhere else was untouched. `getComputedStyle` of the document
  element gave the same value for every legacy name, light and dark, as before (checked once against
  a production build); a snapshot pins the legacy values from there on, and each later change to it
  is on purpose.
- **The full Signal vocabulary.** Every `SIGNAL_TOKENS` name is defined at exactly its Signal value:
  colour, state and elevation in light and dark; type (a `font` shorthand, with its letter-spacing in
  the spec), radius, space, size and motion once.
- **Shared names carry Signal values.** `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, `--accent`,
  `--accent-soft`, `--accent-hover`, `--on-accent`, `--ok`, `--warn`, `--danger`, `--bg-hover` and
  `--bg-active` (`SIGNAL_NAMES_WITH_LEGACY_VALUES`) existed before Signal with the same meaning. The
  foundation kept their old values; since the values step they take their Signal values, light and
  dark, declared once per theme in the Signal part of `tokens.css`. `--icon` is a colour and stays
  one; the Signal icon size is `--icon-size`.
- **Migration map: aliases point at Signal.** `LEGACY_TOKEN_MIGRATION` maps all 89 legacy names:
  `alias` (the name stays) or `retire` (replaced; removed once no rule uses it). Since the values
  step, an alias whose Signal token has another name is exactly `var(<signal>)` in light with no dark
  override, so it follows the Signal token in both themes (`--bg-chrome: var(--bg-window)`,
  `--seo-panel-width: var(--w-panel)`). Retired names keep their values until their surface PR (but
  `--bg-strip` and `--bg-tab-hover`, see Tab row), which moves every rule off them and drops them from
  `tokens.css`: the row stays in the map, marked `removed`;
  layout constants (aliases with `signal: null`) keep theirs. Rules outside `tokens.css` change only
  where a Signal value left text under its minimum (`TEXT_COLOUR_RULES`, below) or a review asked
  for it (the tab spinner's track).
  A retired value that reads an alias moved with it: `--palette-sheet`'s gradient started at
  `var(--bg-chrome)`, so its first stop became `--bg-window` in the values step; the palette's surface
  PR then dropped the gradient for a flat `--bg-window`.
- **Contrast.** Every pair in `CONTRAST_PAIRS` (the text/background and UI/background pairs the
  token sheet names, plus body text, links and on-colour buttons on every surface) reaches its
  WCAG 2.x minimum, 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for UI, in light and dark, computed from the values in
  `tokens.css` (a translucent fill composited over its opaque surface).
- **Tab row, interim.** The active tab follows `--bg-window`, so the retired `--bg-strip` and
  `--bg-tab-hover` were retuned (they would otherwise leave the active tab about 1.05:1 off the strip
  and a hovered tab past it): `TAB_STRIP` keeps the active tab at least 1.1:1 off the strip, a
  hovered tab's luminance between the two and the divider between inactive tabs at least 1.1:1 off
  the strip, in both themes, until the chrome's surface PR.
- **Known exceptions.** `KNOWN_CONTRAST_EXCEPTIONS` records what still misses its minimum, for the
  surface PRs: `--ok` as text (21 rules) is under 4.5:1 in light, and those rules move to `--ok-ink`
  (only the 11px chips moved now).
- **Text the Signal values left too faint.** A few rules drew text in a token whose Signal value
  falls under 4.5:1 where they use it; the values step points them at a token that passes
  (`TEXT_COLOUR_RULES`), and each pair joins `CONTRAST_PAIRS`. The status bar's failed-overrides
  chip, at 4.46:1 with `--danger-ink` on its 14% tint over `--bg-chrome`, takes the sheet's
  -ink-on-soft pairing instead: `--danger-soft` fill (5.30:1 light, 8.68:1 dark).
- **Hex ratchet.** Literal hex colours in renderer stylesheets other than `tokens.css` never exceed
  `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`; each surface PR lowers it to its new count (the command palette's rules held
  no literal hex, their colours were all tokens, so it stayed at 53; the new-tab view's held none
  either, so it stays there).
- **Geist, bundled and local.** The type tokens name Geist and Geist Mono; frost ships them from the
  official `geist` npm package (`GEIST_PACKAGE`: pinned exactly, SIL Open Font License 1.1, listed in
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` with the licence text). Only static woff2 files, only the weights the type
  scale uses (`BUNDLED_FONTS`: Geist 400, 500 for body emphasis, 600; Geist Mono 400), no italics,
  variable or Pixel files. `fonts.css` holds one `@font-face` per file (`font-display: block`: the
  files are local, so there is no flash of a fallback), each `src` a single
  `url('@geist-fonts/<file>') format('woff2')`; the renderer's Vite config aliases `@geist-fonts` to
  the installed package's `dist/fonts/` (its `exports` map hides them). Vite emits the four files as
  hashed assets served from `app://` (the CSP's `font-src 'self'`): never a CDN, a remote URL or a
  `data:` URI, and nothing else of the package is bundled. `main.tsx` imports `fonts.css` right after
  `tokens.css`. The fonts are applied surface by surface, as each surface PR moves its text onto the
  `--text-*` tokens (the command palette first); `--font-ui`, the rest of the chrome's face, stays the
  system stack until its own surface PR.
- **Surface PRs.** A surface's rules (`SIGNAL_SURFACES`: its stylesheet and its class prefix; a rule
  is the surface's when any selector names one of its classes, on a class boundary, or it sits in the
  surface's `@keyframes`) read only Signal tokens and legacy aliases, never a retired name or a
  literal colour; its text takes its face and size from a `--text-*` token (`font: var(--text-*)`,
  with that token's letter-spacing beside it in the same rule when it isn't `0`), at most changing the
  weight to a bundled one.
- **The command palette** (the first surface PR) follows the token sheet's Migration notes and the
  approved palette screen: a flat `--bg-window` band (`--palette-sheet`: "no gradients") holding a
  `--bg-surface` card at `--r-lg` with `--e-ring` and no border or drop shadow (`--palette-shadow`:
  "a band, not a floating sheet"); `--divider` for its rules; rows at `--r-sm` with the selected one
  on `--accent-soft` (no side bar) and its icon tile on `--accent`; a match highlight on
  `--accent-soft` at `--r-xs`, `--bg-surface` on the selected row; key hints on `--bg-surface` with
  `--e-ring` at `--h-badge`, in `--text-mono`; a `--bg-subtle` footer. Matched letters take
  `--text-body`'s emphasis weight (`TEXT_BODY_EMPHASIS_WEIGHT`), where the screen draws 600. The
  confirm step's Back button is a secondary button on the card: a `--bg-subtle` fill with an
  `--e-ring` edge, `--bg-hover` laid over it on hover (the screen's only secondary button, `--bg-surface`
  with `--e-raised`, sits on a tinted band and would vanish on the card). Help's
  key hints (`help.css`), which read the palette's key-hint names, move to the same Signal tokens.
- **The new-tab view** (the start view and "Jump back in") follows the token sheet's Migration notes;
  the approved canvas has no new-tab screen, so the rest comes from the token `use` notes. The view is
  flat `--bg-page` (`--start-glow`: "no gradient washes"); the FrostMark is `--accent` (`--start-mark`),
  in the tab row's empty-tab glyph too; the mark eases in over `--dur-slow` with `--ease-out`. The
  wordmark is `--text-display` (the type scale's largest: it was 44px at weight 300, which Geist isn't
  bundled in) and the hint `--text-body` in `--text-muted`. "Jump back in" takes `--text-caps` for its
  title, and its tiles are `--bg-surface` cards at `--r-md` with `--e-ring` in place of their border
  (`--jump-tile-edge`; a transparent 1px border stays, the edge forced colours draw), the label in
  `--text-body` at its emphasis weight and the host in `--text-small`
  (`--text-faint`, 12px). A tile's monogram is an `--h-chip` square at `--r-sm` on `--accent-soft`
  (`--jump-monogram-bg`) with its letter in `--accent` at `--text-body`'s size and weight 600; History's
  monogram, which shared the retired fill, moves to `--accent-soft` too. A hovered tile rings in
  `--accent` (it was an accent border) and lifts 1px over `--dur-fast`; a focused one takes
  `--focus-ring` beside a transparent 2px outline (forced colours drop the shadow and draw the
  outline). The setup checklist under it (`help.css`), which read `--jump-tile-edge` for its border
  and `--jump-tile-bg` for its fill, takes `--e-ring` and `--bg-surface` the same way.

## Rollout
1. Screenshot baseline (Playwright, light and dark).
2. Foundation (done).
3. Values (done): re-point the aliases and swap the shared names to their Signal values; Geist is
   bundled (done, its own change), applied per surface through the `--text-*` tokens from step 4 on
   (the command palette first); `--font-ui` stays the system stack.
4. One PR per surface: rules move onto Signal tokens, retired names go (`removed`). The command
   palette is first, and the first to apply Geist (a rule reading `--text-*`); a font can now load
   whenever such text is drawn, so `geist-fonts-load` records font requests from launch, not from the
   moment the test starts watching. The new-tab view is next.

## Unit (`apps/desktop/src/__tests__/design-tokens.test.ts`)
- **Scenario: tokens-stylesheet-holds-only-root-tokens** — `tokens.css` has only `:root` blocks
  (light, and dark under the media query) holding only custom properties, never one name twice in a context, and a dark value only overrides
  a light one.
- **Scenario: signal-tokens-are-defined** — every Signal token is in light; every colour, state and
  elevation token is in dark too, and nothing else is; every Signal token, shared names included,
  has exactly its spec values; `--icon` stays a colour.
- **Scenario: legacy-tokens-are-defined** — the migration map has all 89 legacy names; every one not
  `removed` is in `tokens.css`, which holds nothing beyond legacy and Signal names, and every
  replacement named is a Signal token.
- **Scenario: removed-legacy-tokens-are-gone** — only `retire` rows are `removed`; a `removed` name is
  declared in neither theme of `tokens.css`, and no renderer source (`.css`, `.ts`, `.tsx`,
  `index.html`) mentions it outside a comment.
- **Scenario: legacy-token-values-are-pinned** — the 89 legacy names' light and dark values match a
  committed snapshot (the values step updated it on purpose: the aliases became `var()`, their dark
  entries went, and the shared names took their Signal values; each surface PR drops its `removed`
  names from it).
- **Scenario: legacy-aliases-point-at-signal-tokens** — every alias whose Signal token has another
  name is exactly `var(<signal>)` in light and has no dark override; the self-aliases are exactly
  the shared names; `--w-panel` and `--w-rail` equal `SIDEBAR_PANEL_WIDTH` / `SIDEBAR_RAIL_WIDTH`
  (`specs/seo-sidebar.spec.ts`).
- **Scenario: signal-contrast-meets-aa** — every `CONTRAST_PAIRS` pair reaches its minimum WCAG 2.x
  contrast ratio in light and in dark, read from `tokens.css` (`var()` resolved, translucent colours
  composited); the ratio helper matches known values (black on white 21:1, `#777` on white ≈ 4.48).
- **Scenario: known-contrast-exceptions-are-current** — each `KNOWN_CONTRAST_EXCEPTIONS` pair still
  misses its minimum in at least one theme, is not in `CONTRAST_PAIRS`, and exactly `rules`
  declarations in the renderer's stylesheets draw text in its `fg` (so fixing them removes the entry).
- **Scenario: tab-strip-orders-strip-hover-active** — in light and dark, the active tab
  (`TAB_STRIP.active`) against the strip reaches `TAB_STRIP.minActiveOnStrip`, and the hover fill
  composited over the strip has a luminance strictly between the strip's and the active tab's; the
  divider between inactive tabs (`TAB_STRIP.divider`) reaches `TAB_STRIP.minDividerOnStrip` against
  the strip.
- **Scenario: text-colour-rules-resolve** — for each `TEXT_COLOUR_RULES` entry, in light and dark,
  the cascade over its `element` selectors in its stylesheet resolves `color` to `var(<color>)` (and
  `background` to `var(<background>)` where the entry names one), and that pair is in
  `CONTRAST_PAIRS`.
- **Scenario: no-other-stylesheet-declares-root-tokens** — no other renderer stylesheet declares a
  custom property in a rule whose selector starts with `:root` or `html` (`html.x`,
  `:where(:root)`, … included).
- **Scenario: tokens-load-before-every-other-stylesheet** — `main.tsx` imports `tokens.css` first
  among stylesheets and before `App`.
- **Scenario: surface-rules-read-signal-tokens** — for each `SIGNAL_SURFACES` entry, every rule of the
  surface in its stylesheet (any selector in its list names one of the surface's classes on a class
  boundary, at any nesting: `@media`, `@container`; or it is in the surface's `@keyframes`) reads only
  Signal tokens, legacy aliases and component-scoped custom properties (declared in the same
  stylesheet) in `var()` (whitespace allowed, no fallback in any property); declares no Signal or
  legacy name; holds no hex colour or colour function in any property; a colour-bearing value
  (`background-image` and custom properties included) holds only those, `transparent`,
  `currentColor`, `inherit`, `none`, lengths and `color-mix()` (so hex, `rgb()`, a gradient, `unset`,
  `initial`, any named colour fail; `text-decoration` may also name its line and style keywords); a
  rule whose `box-shadow` reads `--focus-ring` sets an `outline` forced colours draw (non-zero width,
  not `none`: `outline: 2px solid transparent`); no `font-size`, `font-family` or `line-height`; `font` only `var(--text-*)`; a
  rule whose `--text-*` token has a non-zero tracking sets exactly that `letter-spacing`, and any
  `letter-spacing` equals the tracking of the token its own rule sets; a `font-weight` is one
  `BUNDLED_FONTS` has for the family of its rule's own `--text-*` token (or for Geist when the rule
  inherits its font); at least one rule sets `font: var(--text-*)`. The guard itself catches a mixed
  selector list, an ancestor-qualified selector, `var( --retired)`, a named colour, a `var()`
  fallback (in a colour and in `padding`), a colour in the surface's keyframes, a caps rule without
  its letter-spacing, a body rule with caps letter-spacing, a gradient `background-image`,
  `color: unset`, Geist Mono at 500, a redeclared Signal or legacy name, a component property holding
  `rgb()`, `rgb()` in `filter`, hex in `scrollbar-color`, and a `--focus-ring` with `outline: 0` or
  no outline; it accepts a component property (`--tone-ink: var(--ok-ink)`) read in the same rule,
  `text-decoration: underline`, and `--focus-ring` beside `outline: 2px solid transparent`; it ignores
  `.palettes`, `.x-palette`, and `.table-*` for a `.tab` surface.
- **Scenario: hex-colours-do-not-grow** — the literal hex colours outside `tokens.css` (comments
  aside) stay at or under `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`.

## Unit, fonts (`apps/desktop/src/__tests__/fonts.test.ts`)
- **Scenario: bundled-fonts-cover-the-type-scale** — the (family, weight) pairs of `BUNDLED_FONTS`
  are exactly those the `SIGNAL_TOKENS.type` `font` shorthands use (each shorthand's weight and first
  family), plus Geist at `TEXT_BODY_EMPHASIS_WEIGHT` (which `--text-body`'s `use` names); every file
  is a static, upright woff2.
- **Scenario: fonts-stylesheet-declares-bundled-fonts** — `fonts.css` holds only `@font-face` blocks,
  exactly one per `BUNDLED_FONTS` entry (its family, weight, `font-style: normal`,
  `font-display: block`), each `src` a single local `url('@geist-fonts/<file>') format('woff2')` (no
  `http(s):`, no `data:`); the renderer's Vite config aliases `@geist-fonts` to the installed
  package's `dist/fonts/`; `main.tsx` imports `fonts.css` right after `tokens.css`.
- **Scenario: geist-is-pinned-and-installed** — `apps/desktop/package.json` pins `geist` to exactly
  `GEIST_PACKAGE.version` (no range); the installed package has that version; each `BUNDLED_FONTS`
  file exists there, larger than Vite's 4 KB inline limit (so it is never inlined as `data:`), and
  starts with the woff2 signature `wOF2`; its `LICENSE.txt` is the SIL Open Font License 1.1; and
  `NOTICE_PACKAGES` lists `geist`.

## End to end (`apps/desktop/e2e/fonts.e2e.ts`, the built app)
- **Scenario: geist-fonts-load** — a test-only main-process preload (`e2e/font-request-log.cjs`,
  required before the app's own code) records, from launch, every `app:` request for a woff2 with its
  response, and every console message of every page with that page's URL. In the chrome
  (`app://app/`), once the document has loaded (so the `@font-face` rules are registered) and with a
  `securitypolicyviolation` listener installed first, `document.fonts.load()` of each `BUNDLED_FONTS`
  face resolves to a loaded `FontFace` of that family and weight, whether or not a rule had already
  drawn it. Every `@font-face` `src` `url()` in the chrome's stylesheets resolves under
  `app://app/assets/` (so none is a CDN or `data:`), and so does every font entry in the chrome's
  Resource Timing buffer (kept from navigation start; a font fetched from any other origin would be
  there). One snapshot of the recorded requests, taken once they name a URL per bundled face, has
  exactly one URL per face, all under `app://app/assets/`, each answered 200 `font/woff2`. No CSP
  violation was reported: no event, and no CSP console message from an `app:` page since launch (a
  tab's own console is not the chrome's); a probe the chrome logs first is seen in that log with its
  `app:` URL, so the log is known to record. (The chrome page can't be reloaded to start clean: its
  navigation guard aborts that. No `session.webRequest` listener is used: one per event per session
  would replace the app's own.)
