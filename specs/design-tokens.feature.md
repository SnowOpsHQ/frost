# Feature: Design tokens (Signal foundation and values)

Spec: `specs/design-tokens.spec.ts` (`TOKENS_STYLESHEET`, `SIGNAL_TOKENS`, `THEMED_SIGNAL_GROUPS`,
`SIGNAL_NAMES_WITH_LEGACY_VALUES`, `LEGACY_TOKEN_MIGRATION`, `CONTRAST_PAIRS`, `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`). Source of truth:
the Signal token sheet (its values and its Migration table) and the round-2 council decisions.
Code: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/tokens.css`, imported by `main.tsx`. Each line maps to one named test.

## Decisions
- **One token source.** Every custom property that lives on `:root` is declared in `tokens.css`,
  light in a `:root` block and dark in a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` `:root` block that
  redefines only the names whose value changes. No other renderer stylesheet declares a custom
  property on `:root` (or `html`). Properties scoped to a component's own selector (`.seo-speed`,
  `.tab`, `.seo-ring`, `.devtools`, …) stay beside their rules.
- **Loaded first.** `main.tsx` imports `tokens.css` before any other stylesheet and before `App`
  (whose components import the feature stylesheets). No stylesheet is lazy-loaded.
- **Foundation: no visual change.** The legacy tokens moved into `tokens.css` with their names and
  values unchanged; a rule body anywhere else was untouched. `getComputedStyle` of the document
  element gave the same value for every legacy name, light and dark, as before (checked once against
  a production build); a snapshot pins the legacy values from there on, and each later change to it
  is on purpose.
- **The full Signal vocabulary.** Every `SIGNAL_TOKENS` name is defined at exactly its Signal value:
  colour, state and elevation in light and dark; type (a `font` shorthand, with its letter-spacing in
  the spec), radius, space, size and motion once.
- **Shared names carry Signal values.** `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, `--accent`,
  `--accent-soft`, `--accent-hover`, `--on-accent`, `--ok`, `--warn`, `--danger`, `--bg-hover` and
  `--bg-active` (`SIGNAL_NAMES_WITH_LEGACY_VALUES`) existed before Signal with the same meaning. The
  foundation kept their old values; since the values step they take their Signal values, light and
  dark, declared once per theme in the Signal part of `tokens.css`. `--icon` is a colour and stays
  one; the Signal icon size is `--icon-size`.
- **Migration map: aliases point at Signal.** `LEGACY_TOKEN_MIGRATION` maps all 89 legacy names:
  `alias` (the name stays) or `retire` (replaced; removed once no rule uses it). Since the values
  step, an alias whose Signal token has another name is exactly `var(<signal>)` in light with no dark
  override, so it follows the Signal token in both themes (`--bg-chrome: var(--bg-window)`,
  `--seo-panel-width: var(--w-panel)`). Retired names and layout constants (`signal: null`) keep
  their values until their surface PR; no rule outside `tokens.css` changes.
- **Contrast.** Every pair in `CONTRAST_PAIRS` (the text/background and UI/background pairs the
  token sheet names) reaches its WCAG 2.x minimum, 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for UI, in light and dark,
  computed from the values in `tokens.css` (a translucent fill composited over its surface).
- **Hex ratchet.** Literal hex colours in renderer stylesheets other than `tokens.css` never exceed
  `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`; each surface PR lowers it.

## Rollout
1. Screenshot baseline (Playwright, light and dark).
2. Foundation (done).
3. Values (done): re-point the aliases and swap the shared names to their Signal values; Geist is
   bundled in its own change.
4. Next, one PR per surface: rules move onto Signal tokens, retired names go.

## Unit (`apps/desktop/src/__tests__/design-tokens.test.ts`)
- **Scenario: tokens-stylesheet-holds-only-root-tokens** — `tokens.css` has only `:root` blocks
  (light, and dark under the media query) holding only custom properties, never one name twice in a context, and a dark value only overrides
  a light one.
- **Scenario: signal-tokens-are-defined** — every Signal token is in light; every colour, state and
  elevation token is in dark too, and nothing else is; every Signal token, shared names included,
  has exactly its spec values; `--icon` stays a colour.
- **Scenario: legacy-tokens-are-defined** — all 89 legacy names are in `tokens.css`, which holds
  nothing beyond legacy and Signal names, and every replacement named is a Signal token.
- **Scenario: legacy-token-values-are-pinned** — the 89 legacy names' light and dark values match a
  committed snapshot (the values step updated it on purpose: the aliases became `var()`, their dark
  entries went, and the shared names took their Signal values).
- **Scenario: legacy-aliases-point-at-signal-tokens** — every alias whose Signal token has another
  name is exactly `var(<signal>)` in light and has no dark override.
- **Scenario: signal-contrast-meets-aa** — every `CONTRAST_PAIRS` pair reaches its minimum WCAG 2.x
  contrast ratio in light and in dark, read from `tokens.css` (`var()` resolved, translucent colours
  composited); the ratio helper matches known values (black on white 21:1, `#777` on white ≈ 4.48).
- **Scenario: no-other-stylesheet-declares-root-tokens** — no other renderer stylesheet declares a
  custom property in a rule whose selector starts with `:root` or `html` (`html.x`,
  `:where(:root)`, … included).
- **Scenario: tokens-load-before-every-other-stylesheet** — `main.tsx` imports `tokens.css` first
  among stylesheets and before `App`.
- **Scenario: hex-colours-do-not-grow** — the literal hex colours outside `tokens.css` (comments
  aside) stay at or under `HEX_COLOUR_RATCHET`.
